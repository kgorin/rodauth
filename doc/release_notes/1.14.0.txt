= New Features

* A change_password_notify feature has been added, which emails the
  user when the change_password feature is used to change their
  password.  This can alert the user when their password may have
  been changed without their knowledge.

= Other Improvements

* When using the account_expiration feature with the reset_password
  feature, resetting the passwords for expired accounts is no longer
  allowed.  Note that the previous behavior isn't considered a
  security issue, because even after resetting their password,
  expired accounts could not login.

* When using the account_expiration feature with the lockout feature,
  unlocking expired accounts is no longer allowed.  Note that the
  previous behavior isn't considered a security issue, because even
  after unlocking the account, expired accounts could not login.
