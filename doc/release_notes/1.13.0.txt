= New Features

* A cache_templates configuration method has been added, which can be
  set to false to disable the default caching of templates.  The main
  time you would want to use this is if you were overriding Rodauth's
  templates with your own templates and modifying such templates in
  development mode.  If that is the case, you may want to use
  something like:

    cache_templates(ENV['RACK_ENV'] != 'development')

* An invalid_previous_password_message configuration method has been
  added to the change_password feature, which overrides the default
  invalid_password_message configuration method if the incorrect
  previous password is used when changing the password.  This is
  designed for use when invalid_password_message has been overridden
  and the message doesn't make sense in the change password case.

* A json_response_body(hash) configuration method has been added to
  the jwt feature, allowing for custom formatting of the JSON
  response body.  This is called with the hash to use in the
  response, and should return a JSON-formatted string. Example:

    json_response_body do |hash|
      super('status'=>response.status, 'detail'=>hash)
    end

= Other Improvements

* In the jwt feature, if json_response_custom_error_status? is set to
  true, custom error statuses will be used if only_json? is set to
  true, even if the request is not in JSON format.  Previously,
  custom error statuses were only used if the request was in JSON
  format.
